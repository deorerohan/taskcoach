1. X-Launcher informations
--------------------------
X-Launcher is part of winPenPack project. It allows to freely change all the 
starting options of programs, in order to make them portable, i.e. runnable
by removable storage devices, like USB keys or external hard disks.
In this new version, the winPenPack Team has greatly improved the code of previous
1.1 version, developed by original author, Gabriele Tittonel.

-------------

Modifications between 1.3.1 and 1.4 releases:

- (Bug fixed) Splash Screen: code rewritten for increase programs startup 
  and avoid blocks caused by protection systems.

  folder was already existing, the source folder was inserted within it.

- (Bug fixed) Improved management of multiple processes (win2000 bug).

- (Improvement) StringRegExpReplace: new function that allows to modify text 
  files using Regular Expressions.

- (Improvement) StringReplace: new option for StringReplace function; allows to 
  overwrite start and end string delimitators.

- (Improvement DirMove: new options for DirMove function; allow to precisely define 
  the behavior in the function if the destination folder already exists.

- (Improvement) New variables containing all the names of the folders involved in 
  the portabilization process, for a better management of rewriting paths.



Modifications between 1.3 and 1.3.1 releases:

- (Bug fixed) IsClosing bug: in case of incorrect or incomplete launcher
  closure, the "X-Software is closing" message was shown, preventing
  to run the Software until manual deletion of temporary files.

- (Bug fixed) IsRunning bug: in case of incorrect or incomplete launcher
  closure, the variable "IsRunning" remained set to TRUE, preventing the
  correct run of the launcher in subsequent runs.

- (Added) System shutdown: added automatic launcher closure on case of 
  system shutdown.



Modifications between 1.1 and 1.3 releases:

- (BugFix) Performance improvements: page faults error and too high 
  CPU consumption (fixed using the RunWait() instruction and other tricks).

- (BugFix) IsRunning bug: starting multiple istances of an application,
  at the second run IsRunning is set to False, so, on the third (fith, 
  seventh, etc.) run, the Launcher is executed as was the first one.

- (BugFix) Single Launcher bug: if the X-Launcher.cfg file is not 
  properly set, the temporary folders are overwritten.

- (BugFix) Java applications bug: with Java applications, the RunAfter
  section was not correctly processed if multiple Java (istances or 
  applications) was executed.

- (BugFix) RunWait=false bug: using this option, the temporary
  folders were not deleted.

- (BugFix) ShowSplash bug: on Vista and Win2000, the Splash Screen
  was not visualized.

- (BugFix) WriteToReg: the "%%%%" string was written as "%%"
  on the .reg file.

- (BugFix) MultipleIstance=false (with Java) bug: used with Java 
  programs, this parameter did not work correctly.

- (BugFix) IsClosing bug: restart of an application was inhibited if the
  previous instance was still performing close operations (for obsolete or 
  very slow operative systems).

- (BugFix) Network address bug: the launcher was not able to resolve
  network address.

- (Improvement) New features Local AppData and Local Settings: allows 
  the launcher to work on folders
  C:\Documents and Settings\USER\Local Settings and 
  C:\Documents and Settings\USER\Local Settings\Application Data.

- (Improvement) Graphics: modified Splash Screen and main icon.
