1. X-Software informations
--------------------------
This package includes a portable program, called X-Software, that can be used 
with winPenPack or standalone. It does not require any installation, it does 
not save its settings into Windows registry and/or user folders and can be 
easily carried between different PCs through USB Pendrives or portable Hard Disk, 
storing personal settings into \User\Program_Name folder. For using this program, 
simply execute X-Software.exe. For include it into winPenPack, use "Install 
X-Software..." menu option (see below).



2. JRE requirements
-------------------
If the X-Software requires Java Runtime Environment, download it from 
http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp choosing "Windows XP/Vista/2000/2003 
Offline", install it on hard disk and copy "bin" and "lib" java folders 
(from C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.XXX) into X-Software_name\Lib\Java folder 
(this will "delete" the intermediate folder "jre1.XXX"). Then uninstall Java 
from your hard disk.



3. How to install the X-Software in winPenPack
----------------------------------------------
This program can be automatically installed in winPenPack menu using the "Install 
X-Software..." option of winPenPack menu. The winPenPack menu can be downloaded 
from this address: http://www.winpenpack.com/main/download.php?view.12

4. How to update the X-Software
-------------------------------
X-Softwares save their settings in X-Software\User\Program_Name folder. 
If an X-Software is included into winPenPack, it can be automatically updated 
installing the latest release over the owned one, through the "Install X-Software..." 
menu option. If an X-Software is used standalone, it can be manually updated, 
replacing the \User\Program_Name folder of latest release with the corresponding 
\User\Program_Name folder of the owned release, always following folders structure.

5. X-Software localization 
--------------------------
To run the program in Italian (where allowed), at first run execute 
X-Software.exe with the X-Software.ini located in the main folder of 
the program. Generally, the main .ini also deletes all the additional languages 
but Italian. To run the program in the language of the operating 
system or in English, and to keep all languages supported by the program, 
overwrite the X-Software.ini file inside the main folder with the one located in 
"English_users" folder, and start X-Software.exe. This is done automatically 
by installing the X-Software in the winPenPack menu through the "Install 
X-Software..." option. In this case, if the menu has the Italian interface, 
will be read the main .ini and the program will start in Italian. If, instead, 
the menu interface is in any other language, will be read the english .ini and 
the program will start in English or in the language of the operating system.
