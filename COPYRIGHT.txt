The following files do not include any copyright information except
for the original author's name:

 - taskcoachlib/thirdparty/snarl.py: that's how we found it on the Interwebs.
 - taskcoachlib/i18n/po2dict.py: same.
 - taskcoachlib/persistence/xml/templates.py: because it's a generated
    file.

Also thanks to Nicolas Boulenguez for helping make this list complete,
doing some anal harm to various lepidopterans in the process (French
expression, I'm not sure it translates well in English).
