# taskcoach

I started using [Task coach](https://www.taskcoach.org) application. It's great and very simple to use but there are few modifications which I like.
Hence copied source code from using *"svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/taskcoach/code/trunk taskcoach-code"*.


## Changes planned

- Planning to move main source code to support Python 3
- Try to move code to use wxPython3 else rewrite to use command line application.
- Change to web app using flask
